That is why I could never be popular as a philosopher. Like a healer, yes. But that is a completely different matter. Inspiration has a wonderful power over souls whose horizons do not extend beyond their own noses. I have always wondered whether a man in that position should feel like a scoundrel, or like a chosen one of the truth.
